## Hi there

- 👋 Hi, I’m @zitzeronion (Stefan Zitz)
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in physics and computational fluid dynamics. My main expertise is in the fluid dynamics of thin liquid films and the lattice Boltzmann method. Usually computational fluid dynamics goes hand in hand with a stupid amount of data, although I like fancy 3D animations, I enjoy a simple graph 📈 even more.
- 🔭 I’m currently working at the [RCPE](https://www.rcpe.at/en/en_home/) as a Senior Scientist. I help with problems related to computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, powders and pills 💊.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are potentially relevant to the pharmaceutical sector 🏥, both scientific and industrial. 
- 📫 Please contact me at stefan.zitz@tugraz.at if you would like to get in touch.
- ✈️ I have worked in Germany 🇩🇪, Denmark 🇩🇰 and Austria 🇦🇹. If you get the chance to visit Copenhagen, definitely do it, it’s such a lovely place with delicious coffee!
